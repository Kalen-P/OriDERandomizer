v2.6.7

-Removed an impossible path, expecting climb-only access to swamp from the grotto teleporter area
-Accessing the spider sac energy cell from grove with wall interaction and glide is now in standard (when the rest of the spider sac area is still inaccessible)

v2.6.6

-Remove the microledge cjump from the grotto teleporter area up to swamp and grove from standard (was present in error)
-Climb+Glide is now sufficient to access iceless from grotto

v2.6.5

-Fix an error that was preventing the generation of daily seeds

v2.6.4

-Removed some impossible paths (spirit tree and death gauntlet with no wall interaction)

v2.6.3

-Added a copy of grenade to the plant at the end of the forlorn escape

v2.6.2

-Luring a fronkey into the spirit caverns to access the lower 3 pickups with only bash is now in standard
-Clean water can no longer appear on the final escape in standard
-Added several master paths:
    Bash+CFlame access to the CFlame tree
    Bashless Horu climb
    Iceless

v2.6.1

-Wall Jump and Charge Flame now give access to the valley entry plant in expert
-Forlorn now requires some form of verticality to clear in standard (since you might drop the orb off before clearing the rest)
-Going over the blackroot boulder no longer requires verticality in standard -- it is assumed that if you know how to glitch the boulder to break it without stomp, you know to get the teleporter before doing so and getting stuck on the low ground

v2.6

DLL changes:

-Added OriDERandoDecoder.dll to decrypt tournament seeds. Place this in the same directory as Assembly-CSharp.dll
-When activating a skill tree, seed progress is now shown automatically
-Sein now follows Ori when using Alt+R
-Added RandomizerSettings.txt (created automatically on launch). Currently, the only setting is choosing the deadzone for controller bashing (a number between 0 and 1, higher = more deadzone). Alt+L after changing this setting will make it take effect.

Seed generator changes:

-Clues mode is now the default selection on the web seed generator
-Inputting "daily" (no quotes, case insensitive) into the seed field will now use the current day to seed the generator
-Inputting "vanilla" (no quotes, case insensitive) into the seed field will return a seed with everything in its vanilla location


v2.5

To update to v2.5, please delete RandomizerRebindings.txt in steamapps/common/Ori DE. A new default file will automatically be created. Note: to experiment with new binds, reloading the seed will also reload your binds (you don't have to restart the game).

-Reworked the rebinding system to support multiple binds, combination binds, and actions as well as keys
-Added a double bash bind - when the bind specified is held at the end of a bash, a double bash will occur
-Set the default fill method to "balanced"


v2.4

-add entrance randomizer


v2.3

DLL changes:

-Fixed bugs with sync starting and sending data
-Fixed a bug where the clue auto-display would overwrite "show last pickup"
-Trying to enter the final escape without visiting all trees in force trees mode will now display a hint


v2.2

DLL changes:

-Added support for sync seeds -- see http://orirandocoopserver.appspot.com/ (thanks Eiko)
-In clues mode, a message will now appear every time a clue is unlocked

Generator changes:

-Options for creating synced seeds have been added
-Seed files and spoilers are now downloaded separately
-An option has been added to select between different fill algorithms: "classic" and "balanced". Balanced fill has less of a tendency to place progression in newly-accessible one-off locations than the classic fill.

v2.1

Generator changes:

-2 extra mapstones are now in the drop pool. Mapstone 8 is now considered to require 9 mapstones to access, and mapstone 9 is considered to require 11.
-Rocket jumping to the cell left of ginso (the "stomp cell") has been moved from cdash to cdash-farming
-A new path category, "speed-lure", has been added. This contains the more difficult enemy manipulations used in the speedrun -- sorrow bash and the frog break into swamp. The presets containing "speed-lure" are expert, master, and glitched.

DLL changes:

-Clean water visual effects are now activated by having clean water (thanks to Kirefel!)
-Raised the Alt+R position slightly to reduce the chances of falling into blackroot on a slow load
-Alt+R now returns the forlorn orb to the start of the dungeon
-Alt+P now displays mapstone progress and total pickup progress
-Reloading a seed now shows the version number
-Removed a case where duplicating bonus pickups could cause an overflow
-Reduced the chance for a teleportation effect to appear in chaos mode; as a result, the approximate chance of finishing the game while holding right has increased from 30% to 50%
-Changed the default bind for chaos mode to Alt+K
-Added a new command, "Color Shift" (default: Alt+C) when toggled on, this performs a random color change every time a pickup is acquired

Note: due to the new command, the expected format of steamapps/common/Ori DE/RandomizerRebinding.txt has changed. To update, delete this file. Launching the randomizer will create a new default version, which you can edit binds in once again.


v2.0

Logic changes:

-The 100 exp under the drain in swamp is now considered accessible without full swamp access
-The 100 exp in the water at the valley entrance now has a chance of being Bash
-The 100 exp on the valley entry tree is now accessible with only Wall Jump
-Accessing "Raziel No" with only Climb has been removed from standard and added to expert
-Entering swamp using Bash to manipulate the frog (as per the All Skills route) is now in standard
-Some items on the left side of Gumo's Hideout are now considered accessible without vertical movement if you have access from the blackroot connection
-Charge Jump can now substitute for one of Glide/Double Jump for accessing Horu
-Navigating Horu with Bash+Grenade has been added to expert
-Entering valley in expert now requires only one of Stomp or Bash
-Entering sorrow by charge jumping along the spikes is now in expert
-Expert mode no longer requires doublebashing

Clues mode:

-New alternative mode for easing the key hunt (as do shards and limitkeys)
-For each 3 skill trees activated, a random (based on seed) key will have its location revealed by Alt+P
-Locations displayed are based on the area the item counts towards for % completion - for example, the room of the death gauntlet next to glades is treated as grove, and the 2 orbs in the upper left part of valley are treated as sorrow.

Item changes:

-The damage of spirit flame upgrade has been reduced from +2 to +1
-The frequency of mega health and mega energy has been reduced from 5 to 3
-Added teleporter activation items for Forlorn, Grotto, Sorrow, Grove, Swamp, and Valley

Miscellaneous:

-A web-based version of the seed generator is now available at https://sigmasin.github.io/OriDERandomizer
-Spoilers now have more clear formatting
-Spoilers report the seed difficulty rating, based on paths required and how deep skills are located
-Alt+R uses a lower position
-Alt+R can no longer warp displace
-Alt+R will now always reset misty
-Hint messages are now color-coded:
    Green: skills
    Blue: water vein, clean water
    Yellow: gumon seal, wind
    Red: sunstone, warmth
-Pickup location statistics are available here: https://goo.gl/qvYhEU

v1.3

-Alt+R is now disabled when inputlocked or carrying an object
-The mini-iceless jump used in any% to get through swamp has been removed from normal and added to extended
-Entering the grenade tree room with only doublejump or grenade+bash has been added to extended
-A logic path, "extreme", has been added. This includes multiple damage boosts across spikes, use of triple jump, and use of ultra defense to damage boost
-The preset previously called "normal" (normal, speed, lure, dboost-light) has been renamed to "standard"
-The preset previously called "extended" (normal, speed, lure, dboost, dboost-light, cdash, dbash, extended, extended-damage) has been renamed to "expert"
-A preset has been added: "master" (normal, speed, lure, dboost, dboost-light, dboost-hard, cdash, dbash, extended, extended-damage, lure-hard, extreme)
-An argument "--prefer-path-difficulty (easy,hard)" has been added. With this set, the generator will lean towards placing skills and keys at more convenient locations (on easy) or more inconvenient locations (on hard)
-The first line of a seed file will now store more information about the arguments used to create it

v1.2

Bonus powerups:

-Grenade power upgrade radius reduced
-Charge flame efficiency and grenade power upgrade have been merged into "Explosion Power Upgrade". This also increases the damage of charge flame.
-Spirit flame damage/targets upgrades are now combined
-Health efficiency and energy efficiency have been removed

Seed generation:

-Shards mode has been changed to require 3/5 shards rather than 2/3.
-By default, the pickups from map stones are now progressive, meaning that the item you get from a map stone is not tied to the location of the map stone, but rather the total number of fragments you have returned. This obsoletes the strategy of saving before placing a fragment and reloading if the item is not useful. The seed generator now has a flag "--non-progressive-mapstones" which will make map stones behave as they did in 1.1
-Experience values are now randomized during seed generation, and tend to scale up as more areas become accessible. The seed generator now has a flag "--exp-pool" to set the total experience available
-A new flag, "--force-trees" has been added. With this flag set, Ori will be unable to enter the final escape until all skill trees have been visited.

Miscellaneous:

-Door warping to get the experience orb at the bottom of Horu is now in extended logic
-The health efficiency and energy efficiency abilities from the utility tree now affect regeneration
-The randomizer will now auto-generate a file, "RandomizerBindings.txt", which can be used to reassign randomizer functions
-A command has been added to show current skill tree and shard progress - default Alt+P

v1.1

-Fixed some path bugs and key-lock situations
-Charge dash is no longer expected in Glades or Blackroot after finding dash early in extended mode
-Shards can no longer appear inside their own dungeons
-The Sunstone now requires 2/3 shards instead of 3/5
-The Gumon Seal is now included in shards mode
-Limitkeys now includes the Gumon Seal in its restrictions
-If Misty Woods is not in its initial state, Alt+R will change it into the first revisit state. As a result, the 1st, 3rd, and 4th keystones in Misty are now in the drop pool again. The 2nd keystone becomes inaccessible if you Alt+R out of Misty before collecting it, thus, it will always just be a 100 exp orb.

v1.0.1

-Fix "replay last message" not displaying properly

v1.0

-Using mapstones from the far edges will no longer fail to give a pickup
-Picking up an energy cell will no longer remove mega energy
-More paths have been added to "extended" and "glitched" modes
-Minor rebalancing of skill weights for path selection

-Added several additional flags to the seed generator:
--starved: Reduces the rate at which skills appear when not required to progress
--shards: Splits the Water Vein into 3 shards and the Sunstone into 5. Collecting 2 Water Vein shards or 3 Sunstone shards will award the item.
--limitkeys: Causes the Water Vein and Sunstone to only appear at event sources or skill trees
-Alt+P replays the last message (same as Alt+T -- if you don't want to accidentally hit Alt+R)
-Alt+C toggles "Chaos Mode"
-Alt+V toggles messages when in Chaos Mode
-Alt+F forces a chaos effect to spawn

-Mega health and mega energy are no longer removed when energy/health are fully restored

v0.6

-Several path bugs have been fixed
-Petrified plants are now item sources, activated by blowing them up with charge flame, grenade, or charge dash. The petrified plant in the forlorn escape will not hold an important item
-Map stones are now item sources, activated by returning a map stone fragment
-Fixed the UI bug and room lockout after the ginso escape
-Water will now appear clean after finishing the ginso tree, though it will still damage you until clean water is found (indicated by warmth on the pause screen)

-added health as a resource for the seed generator
-added modes for the seed generator configuration:
    -normal: all the standard ways to do things
    -speed: uses some trick that is common in the all skills run
    -lure: involves luring an enemy away from their home
    -dboost: involves extended damage boosting
    -hard: some kind of unintended strategy requiring knowledge particular to the area
    -dbash: involves repeated double bashing
    -dboost-hard: ridiculous dboost strats
    -lure-hard: ridiculous enemy luring strats
    -timed-level: requires a timed levelup to pull off
    -glitched: heaven help you
-rebalanced ability weight to give more variety in the early game    
-added a new command: ctrl+alt+L - reloads randomizer.dat (use to start a new run without restarting the game)
